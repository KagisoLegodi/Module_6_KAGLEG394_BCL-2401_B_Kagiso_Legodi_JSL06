- Calculated the total price of the order based on the selected items.

## Lessons Learned
- Enhanced understanding of DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
- Learned how to create and append HTML elements dynamically.
- Gained experience in handling events and event listeners.
- Deepened knowledge of JavaScript array methods for iteration and manipulation.

## Challenges
